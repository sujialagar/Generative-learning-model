# Topic Modelling

For large sets of textual data, it will return patterns and structures giving meaning to the underlying themes. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is one popular topic modeling technique. It involves creating Corpus, Plotting the coherence scores,craete topic word matrix 
# Text Embedding
The process of converting text to a numerical vector directly useable in machine learning models takes place. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling different similarities and distance calculations.
# Text Summarisation
Summarization refers to the process of reducing a document to its basic points but with the document remaining much shorter in length. In principle, two kinds of basic summarization are possible: extractive and abstractive as implemented in text summarisation.
